  07 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Added a vmware-mod.eclass, and associated vmware-modules-1.0.0.15.ebuild for
  vmware-server-1.0.0.24927.  As soon as an any-any update comes out that
  supports this version, the ebuild will be altered to use that instead.
  
  In the meantime, I've published a small tar file containing the sources from
  the vmware-server release itself.  Hopefully this won't happen very often. 
  I've also added a vmware-modules-1.0.0.14.ebuild, which I'll eventually move 
  the older vmware-server build over to (even though that'll expire soon), just
  so you can see how it's supposed to work...  5:)

  Also updated the vmware-server-console package to build 24927 too.  I need to
  rework the 24927 ebuild PATCHES variable, so I don't need two copies of patches
  floating around for the two versions in portage...

  01 Jun 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:
  Restored older (working) vmware-workstation and vmware-player ebuilds. I also
  masked the newer revisions of the ebuilds for both until I can get everything
  into the eclass like I want.  They ebuilds *shold* work, but I make no
  guarantees.
  
  Some other changes:
  
  * Removed erroneous DEPEND from vmware-workstation-tools
  * Updated eclass to work with either a patch directory or the PATCHES variable
  * Started on src_install for the eclass
  * fixed a few typos here and there
  * Added lots more comments to the eclass

  28 May 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org> :
  Ok, a lot of changes this time round:

  * vmware-player converted to use vmware.eclass
  * workstation/player converted to use vmware-modules
  * udev rule creation moved to vmware-modules
  * eclass modified to work with patch directories
  * dhcpd.conf location fix added to vmware-server
  * vmware-server converted to use vmware_src-unpack
  * player/workstaton added a patch to use modprobe over insmod

  I've tested the latest player/server ebuilds on x86.
  Workstation installed fine, but without a license was hard to test.  5:)
  I didn't want to mess with the any_any patching for the testing, so if 
  that's required we'll have to add the any_any source back into SRC_URI,
  and remove the ANY_ANY="" lines.  Note there may still be some ${product}
  changes needed in the vmware-player ebuild too.

  19 May 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> :
  I know that this is the first version of the ChangeLog, even though we have
  already been committing, but I figured I would add this here to keep things
  in order and so that people know what is going on with the overlay. I just
  made some modifications to the vmware.eclass to give it support for
  pkg_setup, src_unpack, pkg_preinst, and pkg_postinst. I also created a new
  vmware-server revision, but since I haven't tested it yet, I have it marked
  as -* so nobody gets it by accident and blames ikelos. The
  vmware-workstation ebuild for 5.5.1 has been updated, and *should* work, but
  I make no guarantees. I plan on slowly updating everything as time permits,
  and will also be adding more functionality to the eclass. I'm really trying
  to put the brunt of all the code from all of the packages into the eclass,
  since they are all so similar. Anyway, enough of my ranting. Enjoy.
