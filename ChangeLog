  27 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Changed the vmware-server ebuild to make use of ${config_dir}.
  It should also now start applying the amd64 pam.d patch correctly again.
  
  27 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Finally remove the old vmware-modules-101 ebuild, since it's not
  required by any packages in the tree anymore.  I hope to remove the
  vmware-pkg.eclass soon (I can't even remember which version of server
  made use of it, but if that ever gets unmerged, vmware-pkg still needs
  to be there).

  Once all that's done, we should probably move not-vmware-src-install
  over to vmware-src-install (and alias not-vmware-src-install to avoid
  breakages).  After that, there's a few fix-ups (symlinks, desktop icons)
  that need doing.  We're getting closer though, so it might be time
  to start adding ~x86 to some of the workstation/player builds, to get
  some people testing them... 5:)
  
  25 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Pushed out the latest builds for vmware-server/server-console (27828).
  
  23 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Altered the vmware.eclass to create a VMWARE_GROUP for console products too.

  19 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Comment out a line in the eclass that was breaking vmware-server when
  compiled with FEATURES="userpriv".  It seemed to reset all the permissions
  including the set-UID bit.  It was only included to avoid permission
  warnings with vmware-workstation.  If the warnings start again, we'll
  try and figure out another workaround.
  
  19 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Refactored several bits of the vmware.eclass based on the inconsistent naming
  scheme used by vmware-server-console to locate it's configuration info.

  I also finished off converting vmware-server over to the vmware.eclass
  and pushed vmware-server-console over to it too.  Hopefully we're nearly there
  now...  5:)
  
  16 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Ok, just double checked/lined up the vmware-module version numbers
  with the packages building against them.
  
  16 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Just a couple quick changes.
  I modified the vmware-player-1.0.x-r5 ebuild, just a bit of cleaning up.
  I also fixed a tiny typo in the vmware.eclass.

  vmware-player now seems to be a go with the new modules on ~x86 (although I've
  left it masked).

  14 Jun 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org>:
  Well, I've done quite a few changes.
  
  - Ported all of the remaining code from src_install in vmware-workstation to
  vmware.eclass
  - Ported vmware-workstation 3.x and 4.x to vmware-modules and the
  vmware.eclass
  - Removed all older versions/revisions that are currently in the portage tree,
  as they're unnecessary
  - Marked the new 5.5 version of vmware-workstation as ~amd64 and ~x86 as it
  has now been tested and appears to work just fine

  13 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikeloes@gentoo.org>:
  Also today, I removed the last few svn:keywords that meant I had to keep
  recalculating the manifests.  Handy though they might have been, it's easier
  to do revbumps to differentiate the versions, than it is to manually keep 
  redoing those manifests and checking them back in again...
  
  13 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Added revision bumps for vmware-player-1 and vmware-workstation-5.5, to use
  the new style vmware-modules ebuilds.  These haven't been tested at all, but
  are also keyworded "-*" so shouldn't cause any problems.  I've also added 
  the required ebuilds for when vmware-workstations-{3,4} get given the 
  vmware.eclass treatment.

  Let me just reiterate that these ebuilds are *extremely* untested, not just
  the normal untested you're used to...  5;)

  07 Jun 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org>:
  Added a vmware-mod.eclass, and associated vmware-modules-1.0.0.15.ebuild for
  vmware-server-1.0.0.24927.  As soon as an any-any update comes out that
  supports this version, the ebuild will be altered to use that instead.
  
  In the meantime, I've published a small tar file containing the sources from
  the vmware-server release itself.  Hopefully this won't happen very often. 
  I've also added a vmware-modules-1.0.0.14.ebuild, which I'll eventually move 
  the older vmware-server build over to (even though that'll expire soon), just
  so you can see how it's supposed to work...  5:)

  Also updated the vmware-server-console package to build 24927 too.  I need to
  rework the 24927 ebuild PATCHES variable, so I don't need two copies of patches
  floating around for the two versions in portage...

  01 Jun 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:
  Restored older (working) vmware-workstation and vmware-player ebuilds. I also
  masked the newer revisions of the ebuilds for both until I can get everything
  into the eclass like I want.  They ebuilds *shold* work, but I make no
  guarantees.
  
  Some other changes:
  
  * Removed erroneous DEPEND from vmware-workstation-tools
  * Updated eclass to work with either a patch directory or the PATCHES variable
  * Started on src_install for the eclass
  * fixed a few typos here and there
  * Added lots more comments to the eclass

  28 May 2006; Mike Auty <ikelos@gentoo.org> :
  Ok, a lot of changes this time round:

  * vmware-player converted to use vmware.eclass
  * workstation/player converted to use vmware-modules
  * udev rule creation moved to vmware-modules
  * eclass modified to work with patch directories
  * dhcpd.conf location fix added to vmware-server
  * vmware-server converted to use vmware_src-unpack
  * player/workstaton added a patch to use modprobe over insmod

  I've tested the latest player/server ebuilds on x86.
  Workstation installed fine, but without a license was hard to test.  5:)
  I didn't want to mess with the any_any patching for the testing, so if 
  that's required we'll have to add the any_any source back into SRC_URI,
  and remove the ANY_ANY="" lines.  Note there may still be some ${product}
  changes needed in the vmware-player ebuild too.

  19 May 2006; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> :
  I know that this is the first version of the ChangeLog, even though we have
  already been committing, but I figured I would add this here to keep things
  in order and so that people know what is going on with the overlay. I just
  made some modifications to the vmware.eclass to give it support for
  pkg_setup, src_unpack, pkg_preinst, and pkg_postinst. I also created a new
  vmware-server revision, but since I haven't tested it yet, I have it marked
  as -* so nobody gets it by accident and blames ikelos. The
  vmware-workstation ebuild for 5.5.1 has been updated, and *should* work, but
  I make no guarantees. I plan on slowly updating everything as time permits,
  and will also be adding more functionality to the eclass. I'm really trying
  to put the brunt of all the code from all of the packages into the eclass,
  since they are all so similar. Anyway, enough of my ranting. Enjoy.
