		The vSphere Command-Line Interface (vSphere CLI) command set allows you
		to run common system administration commands against ESX/ESXi systems
		from any machine with network access to those systems. You can also run
		most vSphere CLI commands against a vCenter Server system and target any
		ESX/ESXi system that vCenter Server system manages. vSphere CLI commands
		are especially useful for ESXi hosts because ESXi does not include a
		service console.
